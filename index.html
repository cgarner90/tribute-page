            <p class="life-header bold">A brief timeline of the life of Malcolm X</p>
            <ul id="tribute-info">
                <li><span class="bold">1925 - </span>May 19: Malcolm X is born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, the fourth of Earl and Louise Little's seven children. Earl, a Baptist minister, is a follower of Marcus Garvey's black nationalism and serves as Omaha chapter president of Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association. Louise Little serves as the division secretary.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1941 - </span>February: Ella Collins gains custody of Malcolm and he moves to Boston. Over the next few years, he works a number of odd jobs on railroads, in restaurants and bars, at shoeshine stands, and in a jewelry store. Malcolm learns to dress like a hipster, dyes his hair, and starts hustling in Boston (where he's known as "New York Red"), New York (where the nickname is "Detroit Red"), and Detroit.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1943 - </span>October 25: Malcolm, who has responded to his draft notice by loudly proclaiming that he wants to "fight for the Japanese" and kill whites, is found mentally unfit for military service and classified 4F.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1945 - </span>December: Malcolm, who has moved back to Boston, goes on a stealing spree with his black friend Malcolm Jarvis and three white women, one of whom he has been dating.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1946 - </span>January: Malcolm tries to retrieve a stolen $1000 watch from a pawnshop and is arrested and charged with grand larceny, breaking and entering, and firearms possession. He is convicted and, along with Jarvis, receives an eight-to-10-year sentence. The white women have their sentences suspended, but Malcolm's girlfriend serves seven months in prison. The women refused the police suggestion to charge Malcolm and Malcolm Jarvis with rape.

                    February: At the age of 20, Malcolm is sent to jail in Charlestown, Massachusetts, and assigned prisoner number 22843. He will remain behind bars until 1952.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1952 - </span>August 7: Malcolm is released on parole, spends one night with Ella Collins, then goes to Detroit to live with his brother Wilfred. He quickly joins the Nation of Islam and attends meetings at Detroit's Temple No. 1, one of the four temples that the Nation operates at the time. Malcolm rejects the surname "Little" as a slave name given to his family by white oppressors, and he becomes known as "Malcolm X." Dismayed that the Nation of Islam is not attracting more followers (at the time, total nationwide membership was about 400), Malcolm begins an intensive recruiting campaign with Elijah Muhammad's blessing. Soon membership in the Nation begins to soar.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1954 - </span>June: Elijah Muhammad gives Malcolm his highest appointment to date, chief minister of Harlem's Temple No. 7. In Malcolm's words, "For Mr. Muhammad's teachings really to resurrect American black people, Islam obviously had to grow, to grow very big. And nowhere in America was such a single Temple potential available as in New York's five boroughs." Thanks in large part to Malcolm's charisma and tireless recruiting, within the next five years membership in the Nation of Islam swells to 40,000 and supports 49 temples.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1956 - </span>Malcolm's future wife Betty Sanders becomes a member of the Harlem Temple and adopts the name "Betty X." They will marry two years later, after Malcolm proposes by phone from a Detroit gas station, and take up residence in East Elmhurst, Queens.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1964 - </span>March: Suspended "indefinitely" by the Nation of Islam, Malcolm announces plans to form his own organization called "Muslim Mosque Incorporated." The Nation of Islam responds by requesting, via certified mail, that he surrender all its property, including Malcolm's house in Queens. Malcolm predicts that Black Muslim leaders will murder him because "I know where the bodies are buried." While in Washington to observe a Senate filibuster against the Civil Rights Bill, Malcolm has a chance meeting with Martin Luther King Jr. and a photographer snaps the only picture ever taken of the two men together.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1964 pt.2 - </span>April: Malcolm delivers his famous election year "Ballot or the Bullet" speech, then leaves for a five-week tour of Egypt, Lebanon, Liberia, Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, and Saudi Arabia, where he makes a pilgrimage to Mecca and receives a new Islamic name: El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, as well as expresses a somewhat different attitude about race. In Mecca, Malcolm writes, he witnessed "pilgrims of all colors from all parts of this earth displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood like I've never seen before." While still determined to bring charges for mistreatment of African Americans against the United States in the United Nations, Malcolm opines that studying Islam might cause white Americans to turn away from their racism.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1965 - </span>February 14: Malcolm's home in East Elmhurst is firebombed Malcolm X says that it is "upon the orders of Elijah Muhammad." His family is evicted four days later. In Alex Haley's words, "What I was seeing was a man who was valiant beyond belief, whose structural world was tottering, and he was trying to hold it together."</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1965 pt 2. - </span>February 21: Malcolm X is assassinated while speaking at an OAAU rally in Harlem; three members of the Nation of Islam are later convicted despite the fact that the assailant apprehended at the scene Talmadge Hayer insisted that his two co-defendants are innocent.</li>
